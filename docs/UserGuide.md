# TrueRental User Guide

TrueRental is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TrueRental can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TrueRental application.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar truerental.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all clients.

   * `cadd n/Steven Tan e/steventan@abc.com p/98765432` : Adds a client named `Steven Tan` to the TrueRental application.

   * `cdelete 3` : Deletes the 3rd client shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all clients.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `cadd n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items without brackets are mandatory, you must provide a value.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME` for `cadd`, `c/CLIENT_INDEX` and `a/ADDRESS` for `radd`.

* Items in curly brackets "{}" are optional, you may choose not to have them in your command.<br>
  e.g `radd` can be used as `radd c/1 a/BLK 123 Bishan` or as `radd c/1 a/BLK 123 Bishan m/3500`.

* Items in square brackets "[]" are mandatory to have at least one of them, you should not use none of them in a command.<br>
  e.g `cedit` can be used as `cedit 1 n/Steven Tan e/steventan@abc.com p/98765432` or as `cedit 1 n/Steven Tan p/98765432`.

* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `k/KEYWORDS` for `find` can be used as `find k/Steven Tan k/98765432` (2 times), `find k/98765432` (1 time), etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
